# Mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Applying ID Cards

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a mobile graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to apply for ID cards digitally. The goal is to eliminate the need for individuals to visit physical government offices or police stations to submit documents and verify their identity. This digital solution aims to address the challenges faced by remote and rural areas, where limited transportation and long distances make it difficult for people to access government services. Additionally, this project aligns with the ongoing digitization of society, aiming to replace manual paper-based processes with efficient digital workflows.

## Context of Use
### Users Description
The target users for this service encompass a diverse range of individuals, including both genders and Finnish citizens. The service caters to users who are 16 years and older, as younger users may require parental assistance. Users' technological capabilities vary based on their age, with younger individuals and adults being more familiar with technology compared to older users. The latter group, residing in rural areas, might have limited exposure to advanced technology and may exhibit higher levels of distrust. Thus, the GUI design should be simple, intuitive, and accessible to users with varying levels of technological experience.

### Users' Tools & Surroundings
To complete the task of ordering an ID card online, users will require a mobile phone with a data connection, personal information, a photograph retrieval code obtained from a photography studio for a passport photo, and either a banking ID, certificate card, or mobile ID. Since this involves sensitive information, it requires concentration and careful data entry. Users should be in a quiet and private setting to ensure a focused and secure environment.

### Users' Tasks
The tasks involved in the application process are straightforward and basic. Younger users and technologically experienced individuals will have fewer challenges navigating the user interface. However, older users and those less familiar with technology, may require additional support. To bridge the gap, the user interface should align with their mental models by resembling familiar tasks from everyday life, such as booking a metro ticket.

## Guidelines that Led to the Implementation
The GUI implementation follows established guidelines to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The primary objective is to anticipate user needs and provide a coherent design that aligns with users' expectations. The following principles and considerations guided the implementation:

1. Visibility and Predictability:
   - Clear progression through the application process with the ability to move forward and backward.
   - Use of familiar UI elements like arrows for page navigation.
   - Option to exit without saving data, similar to an emergency exit, providing users with control and freedom.

2. Adaptability and Ease of Use:
   - Form-based interface for collecting personal information, mirroring analog forms.
   - Homepage with clear directions and instructions, consistent with everyday applications.

3. Aesthetic Appeal:
   - Pleasing and soothing color theme primarily consisting of blue and white.
   - Minimalistic and subtle design for a visually appealing interface.

4. Error Prevention:
   - Prompting users with error messages when required information is missing, ensuring all fields are appropriately filled.

5. Consistency in Design
