# GUI Implementation for Mobile ID Card Application

## Introduction
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a mobile graphical user interface (GUI) that enables users to apply for ID cards digitally. The goal is to eliminate the need for individuals to visit physical government offices or police stations to submit documents and verify their identity. This digital solution aims to address the challenges faced by remote and rural areas, where limited transportation and long distances make it difficult for people to access government services. Additionally, this project aligns with the ongoing digitization of society, aiming to replace manual paper-based processes with efficient digital workflows.

## Context of Use
### Users Description
The target users for this service encompass a diverse range of individuals, including both genders and Finnish citizens. The service caters to users who are 16 years and older, as younger users may require parental assistance. Users' technological capabilities vary based on their age, with younger individuals and adults being more familiar with technology compared to older users. The latter group, residing in rural areas, might have limited exposure to advanced technology and may exhibit higher levels of distrust. Thus, the GUI design should be simple, intuitive, and accessible to users with varying levels of technological experience.

### Users' Tools & Surroundings
To complete the task of applying for an ID card online, users will require a mobile phone with an active data connection, their personal information, a retrieval code for a passport-sized photo from a photography studio, and their banking ID, certificate card, or mobile ID. Since the task involves handling sensitive information, users should perform it in a private and quiet environment that allows them to concentrate and enter data accurately.

### Users' Tasks
The tasks associated with this service are straightforward and basic. Younger users will likely have fewer challenges interacting with the GUI, given their familiarity with technology. However, adult and older users might face difficulties, and their mental models of the interface should align with analog experiences from their daily lives, such as ordering from a bakery or booking a metro ticket.

## Guidelines that Led to the Implementation
The GUI implementation follows established guidelines to ensure an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The primary objective is to anticipate user needs and provide a coherent design that aligns with users' expectations. Here are some key guidelines followed during the design process:

- Visibility: The GUI allows users to fill in their details and navigate through the application process, with the option to go back and correct errors. This provides users with predictability and a familiar interaction pattern.

- Profile Icon: The use of a profile icon with a person outline enhances recognition and familiarity among users, irrespective of their technological expertise.

- Clear Navigation: The GUI incorporates clear arrows for page navigation, along with a login/logout option accessible through the profile dropdown. This navigation approach aligns with common user experiences in everyday applications.

- Emergency Exit and Editing Capability: Users have the freedom to exit the application without saving their data, providing an emergency exit option. Additionally, allowing users to edit previously entered information empowers them with control and flexibility throughout the process.

- Adaptability: The GUI design is adaptable and consists of user-friendly forms for entering personal information. The homepage provides clear directions, maintaining consistency with commonly used applications. Furthermore, a help page offers instructions for completing the form, assisting users unfamiliar with digital forms.

- Aesthetic and Color Theme: The GUI incorporates a pleasing and soothing color scheme, primarily utilizing shades of blue and white. This minimalist and subtle aesthetic enhances the overall user experience.

- Error Prevention: When users fail to enter necessary details, the GUI displays error messages indicating blank fields that need to be filled. This approach helps users identify and rectify errors promptly.

- Consistent Button Design: Buttons
